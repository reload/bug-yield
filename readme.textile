h1. BugYield

BugYield is a console application which tracks changes to tickets (issues, work items, bugs whatever) across systems to avoid tedious double registrations. 

BugYield currently supports the ticket management system "FogBugz":http://fogbugz.com and time tracking system "Harvest":http://harvestapp.com.

h2. Installation

Clone the repository and remember to initialize submodules. Downloads are currently not functional as GitHub does not include submodules.

h2. Configuration

BugYield needs to know where and how to access the systems involved. This configuration is handled by a config.yml file. Copy the provided config.sample.yml and update it with account information. If your configuration file is not located in the TickTrac root directory you can specify the path to the config file using the <code>--config</code> option.

h2. Usage

BugYield currently supports two use cases: 

# *Time synchronization*: Mapping entries in Harvest to time elapsed in FogBugz tickets 
# *Title synchronization*: Mapping ticket titles from FogBugz to Harvest entries

BugYield works in the context of one or more Harvest projects identified through their id, full name or code. Projects can be specified in the configuration or using the <code>--harvest-project</code> option.

Run <code>bugyield</code> from the command line to show all available commands.

h3. Time synchronization

BugYield can update tickets in FogBugz with time registrations in Harvest. This makes it easier to show how much time has been spent on a ticket and how this corresponds with estimates.

It works like this:

# Add <code>#[ticket-id]</code> without the []'s in the Harvest entry notes
# Run the timesync command
# The elapsed time field for the FogBugz ticket is updated and a new comment is added to the ticket showing the entry id, the time spent, the task type and the notes from Harvest

If the time or task for the Harvest entry is changed at a later point in time, subsequent execution of the timesybc command adds a new comment to the ticket and the elapsed time field is adjusted accordingly.

If a Harvest entry contains multiple ticket ids the time spent is distributed evenly across the mentioned tickets.

h3. Title synchronization

BugYield can update entries in Harvest with ticket titles from FogBugz. This makes it easier to show how much time has been spent on a ticket and how this corresponds with estimates.

It works like this:

# Add <code>#[ticket-id]</code> without the []'s in the Harvest entry notes
# Run the titlesync command
# The entry notes in Harvest are updated with the ticket titles from FogBugz replacing <code>#[ticket-id]</code> with <code>#[ticket-id]([ticket-title])</code>

If a FogBugz ticket title is changed at a later point in time, subsequent execution of the titlesync command makes sure that the Harvest entry notes are updated accordingly.

If a Harvest entry contains multiple ticket ids all the ticket time spent is distributed evenly across the mentioned tickets.

h2. To do

* Support for more ticket management ("Lighthouse":http://lighthouseapp.com) and time tracking systems.
* Improve error handling
